Telephone charades is a hilarious icebreaker event in which a person acts out a clue only for the next person of his team in the line who in turn acts out for the next person of his team and the chain continues like this as a telephone and the last person of the team will say what the clue was. The game is funny because the acting tends to wrap and get distorted based upon each persons interpretation of what is going on!!!
